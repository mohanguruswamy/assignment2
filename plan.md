Plan
====

Clean and condition the data
----------------------------
* Convert activity and subject to factors
* Set out how to divide the data into three sets
* Describe the number of observations
* Mention any outliers


Investigate
-----------

Try to find the significant factors
* Run a classification tree
* Use svd
* Use clustering (which variables produce the clearest clusters?)
* Use random forest?

Build a model
-------------

* Decide on error rates (just use misclassification rate)
* Decide on cross validation strategy (is this within the training data, or can we use validation data?)
* Find the best model
* Make it into a function
